1. What is the function of ! in file permission?
If we provide only execute to a text file how will the file behaves?

cat /etc/sudoers

# Runas alias specification

# User privilege specification
root ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# Group privilege specification
%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
%cloud-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL


#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
what does it mean ? how root and cloud-user are different?
